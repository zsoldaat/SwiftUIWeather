This is a simple weather app built in SwiftUI, fetching data from openweathermap.org.

This app was originally featured in Angela Yu's course "iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp", re-made by me using the SwiftUI framework. 

Here is a demo of the app in action: https://youtu.be/UKKD4s6vQ-4
